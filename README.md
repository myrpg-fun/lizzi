## Events
Much of the lizzi.js API is built around an idiomatic asynchronous event-driven architecture in which certain kinds of objects (called "emitters") emit named events that cause Function objects ("listeners") to be called.

> For instance: a **Data** object emits an event each time when data value is changed; a **Collection** emits an event when data added to collection; removed from etc.

All objects that emit events are instances of the Events class. These objects expose an eventEmitter.on() function that allows one or more functions to be attached to named events emitted by the object. Typically, event names are camel-cased strings but any valid JavaScript property key can be used.

When the EventEmitter object emits an event, all of the functions attached to that specific event are called synchronously. Any values returned by the called listeners are ignored and will be discarded.

The following example shows a simple EventEmitter instance with a single listener. The eventEmitter.on() method is used to register listeners, while the eventEmitter.emit() method is used to trigger the event.

### Passing arguments and this to listeners
The Event.emit() method allows an arbitrary set of arguments to be passed to the listener functions. Keep in mind that when an ordinary listener function is called, the standard this keyword is intentionally set to reference the EventEmitter instance to which the listener is attached.

```javascript
class MyEmitter extends Event{}

const myEmitter = new MyEmitter();

myEmitter.on('event', function(a, b) {
    console.log(a, b, this, this === myEmitter);
});

myEmitter.emit('event', 'a', 'b');
// Prints: 
// a b myEmitter { ... } true

class OtherClass{
    whenEvent(a, b){
        console.log(a, b, this, this === OtherClass);
    }

    constructor(Emitter){
        Emitter.on('event', this.whenEvent, this);
    }
}

new OtherClass(myEmitter);

myEmitter.emit('event', 'x', 'y');
// Prints: 
// a b myEmitter { ... } true
// x y OtherClass { ... } true
```

### Class: Event
#### Event.on(name, function[, self]);
* eventName \<string> | \<symbol> The name of the event.
* listener \<Function> The callback function
* Returns: \<EventListener>
  
Adds the listener function to the end of the listeners array for the event named eventName. No checks are made to see if the listener has already been added. Multiple calls passing the same combination of eventName and listener will result in the listener being added, and called, multiple times.

server.on('connection', (stream) => {
  console.log('someone connected!');
});
Returns a reference to the EventEmitter, so that calls can be chained.

By default, event listeners are invoked in the order they are added. The emitter.prependListener() method can be used as an alternative to add the event listener to the beginning of the listeners array.

```javascript
const myEE = new Event();
myEE.on('foo', () => console.log('a'));
myEE.prependListener('foo', () => console.log('b'));
myEE.emit('foo');
// Prints:
//   b
//   a
```

#### Event.off(*EventListener* listener);
#### Event.off([name][, function][, self]);
Remove event from class by eventListener, by name, by function or by self.
